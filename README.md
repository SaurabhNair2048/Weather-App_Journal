# Weather-Journal App Project
## Overview
In this project, we have created an asynchronous webapp that uses external Web API and user data to dynamically update the UI.

## Extras
* The API '/save' is used to store the user data and external web API data to the server.
* The API '/fetch' is used to fetch the details from the server to the front end to be displayed in the UI.
